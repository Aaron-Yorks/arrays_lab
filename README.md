This lab provides an opportunity to practice defining, accessing, and manipulating arrays. **Note:** Feel free to reference the arrays lesson, collaborate, google, etc.

This lab **is a deliverable**. For submitting this assignment, make sure to first fork this repo over to your own Github, then clone it down from that location. cd into the directory that clone creates and then get started. Once you've finished the work, make sure to add, commit and push the changes to your repo followed by making a pull request to submit the work so it can be graded. We’re happy to provide support as having some issues with Gitflow week one is to be expected.

Make sure to test your Javascript file by running node arrays.js from inside of this directory. Making sure that things are coming through as you would expect is incredibly important; never just assume things are working as you would expect them to without confirming they are.
